# Backyard-Painting
## Generating panorama paintings

In the COVID-19 situation, our exploration is limited. Maybe wandering around the internet should be a good idea.

Painting natural panoramas is something special, and needs a lot of techniques. However, by this time you could generate your own panorama paintings, and use it for wallpaper or anything.

This project was a simple implementation of Neural Style Transfer, some kind of generative network. Running on Tensorflow platform, this network utilize transfer model from the tensorhub.

# How to play?

* Open the notebook, it is better to open it in Colab unless you have fancy GPU.
* Just run the cell. You have two options whether to upload the files or copying the URLs. 
* Enjoy!

### You could contribute for my future plan to pursue my PhD too!
